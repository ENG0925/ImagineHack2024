This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

### Problem Statement and Solution

The current chalenge faced by many organizations is handling large document workloads, which necessiates significant manpower and results in prolonged time to complete tasks. This cumbersome process can be both time-consuming and costly, requiring many employees to manually input and proccess data. To address this, our platform offers an innovative solutoin that can dramatically streamline operations. Our advanced system scans invoices and extracts all necessary information with high accuracy, ensuring that no critical data is missed. Once extracted, this data is securely stored in a datbase, making it easily accessable for further processing.

In addition to data extraction, our platform goes a step further by analysing the stored data and visualizing it in intuitive charts. This enables users to gain valuable insights at a glance, facilitating more informed decision-making. By transforming raw data into comprehensible visual formats, the platform helps organizations to quickly interpert trends and patterns, thereby enhancing strategic planning and operational efficiency. Furthermore, our solution integrates cutting-edge AI technology, which includes a sophisticated chatbox designed to assist users in quickly locating the specific data they need. This feature significantly reduces the time spent searching for information, allowing users to focus on more critical tasks.

### AI Capabilities and Advantages

The AI component of our platform is designed with the user's needs in mind, offering personalised responses to queries through an intuitive chat interface. This personalization ensures that users receive relevent information tailored to their specific questions, enhancing the overall user experience. Utilizing advanced algorithims, the AI can search through vast amonts of data to find exactly what the user is looking for, making data retrieval both quick and efficient.

Moreover, the AI is capable of conducting smart analyses of the extracted data, identifying key insights and trends that might not be immediatly apparent. This level of analysis provides users with deeper understanding and actionable intelligence, enabling them to make more informed decisions. The AIâ€™s ability to handle and process large volumes of data with speed and accuracy significantly reduces the time required for manual data entry and proccessing, which in turn minimizes the need for additional manpower.

By reducing the dependency on human intervention, our platform allows organizations to operate with fewer employees, leading to substantial cost savings. The efficiency gains achieved through AI assistance mean that large workloads can be managed in a much shorter period, freeing up valuable time and resources for other important activites. Instead of the traditional, labor-intensive method of manual data entry, users can now simply upload their files, and our system will take care of the rest. This not only streamlines the data entry process but also reduces the likelihood of human error, ensuring greater accuracy and reliability in data management.

### Future Enhancements

Our platform is continuously evolving to meet the growing needs of our users. Some of the planned future enhancements include:

- **Charts**: More charts will be implemented in different categories, providing a broader range of data visualization options to help users better understand their data.
  
- **Accuracy**: We aim to improve the accuracy of our AI by further training it to understand user input more effectively, thereby providing more precise outputs.
  
- **AI Chat**: The chatbox will be enhanced to cover a wider range of functionalities. In addition to retrieving data from the database, it will also be able to answer questions and offer suggestions on how companies can adress their monthly financial issues, providing more comprehensive support to users.
  
- **Various Types of Inputting Document Information**: The platform will support scanning barcodes or QR codes printed on hardcopy invoices, directing the system to the softcopy and extracting the necessary data. Additionally, we plan to allow more types of financial-related documents to be uploaded in the future, such as Excel sheets, expanding the range of documents our system can handle.

In conclusion, our platform offers a comprehensive solutoin to the challenges posed by large document workloads. By leveraging advanced AI technology, it enhances efficiency, reduces costs, and improves overall operational effectiveness. The integration of features such as data extraction, analysis, visualization, and personalised AI assistance makes our platform an invaluable tool for any organization looking to optimize their document management processes. With continuous enhancements on the horizon, our platform will only become more capable and versatile, further solidifying its value to our users.
